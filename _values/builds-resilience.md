title: "Builds resilience"
short_write_up: "<p>Resilience is the ability to withstand and recover from shocks to the system. A system is only as strong as its weakest part. In the face of accelerating and deepening crises of culture, economy, and ecology, how can our communities become strong and versatile enough to absorb shocks, and eventually to heal the damage? 
Resilient communities are regenerative. They can bounce back in the face of injury and disease, restoring health to their members and their ecosystem. Resilient communities decentralize power and knowledge, defending against debilitating vacuums created by the loss of a single charismatic leader, a single electrical station, or a single institution that concentrates information. They are also rooted in history, in community, and in place. A commitment to building resilience requires many leaders, many sages, a dense web of interdependence, and a deep capacity for healing and renewal.</p>"
