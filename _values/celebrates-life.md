title: "Celebrates life"
short_write_up: "<p>As we construct new economic and social systems, we must not forget to dance, sing, play, pray and create. If oppression is a denial of life, a process of dehumanization, then the affirmation of life should be at the center of our efforts to build a better world. That means honoring culture, art and love in the midst of struggle. It means inviting one another to bring our whole selves to our work, our spiritual and creative selves, our passions, our ways of learning and communicating, our everyday joys and sorrows. When institutions define us by narrow slices of our identities, by the stuff they tell us we need, or by where we fall on an anonymous bell curve, we resist by celebrating one another and the larger webs of life to which we are connected.</p>"
