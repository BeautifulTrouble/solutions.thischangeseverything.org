title: Advances justice
short_write_up: "<p>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims we all &#8220;born free and equal in dignity and rights,&#8221; yet for vast numbers of us, our dignity and rights are under attack from the moment we are born. Systems of oppression are entrenched, insidious, and intersecting across identities such as race, ethnicity, class, gender identity, sexuality, faith, ability, age, education level, or the places we call home. To meaningfully tackle the deep problems with our climate and economy, we must recognize and investigate the larger system of injustice, with roots in histories of colonization, imperialism and exploitation. No grand project of renewal can happen if we continue to advance access and opportunity for some at the expense of others. We all must fight to expand the space for oppressed people to lift up their voices, to claim their right to culture and livelihood, and to lead.</p>"
