title: "Extends the commons"
short_write_up: "<p>For centuries, wealthy individuals, corporations, and the state have sought to enclose and privatize commonly held resources, particularly those belonging to indigenous and agrarian societies that understand our relationship to the commons as one of stewardship rather than ownership. These communities have resisted such encroachments, fighting not just to defend common control of land, housing, healthcare, human knowledge, and other vital spheres that shape our daily lives, but to extend those commons. Today’s efforts to defend and extend the commons are helping us all to rediscover relationships rooted in cooperation, solidarity and stewardship, rather than competition, egotism and exploitation.</p>"
