title: Displaces extractive industry
short_write_up: "We put our hearts into our work so that our lives and communities are made stronger and more beautiful. The dominant economic paradigm, however, runs on extraction. A coal company will strip mine an Appalachian hillside, and once they’ve taken all that’s valuable, leave behind an ugly, toxic scar. In a similar way, they also extract value out of the workers they employ. This kind of systematic extraction — of labor and carbon — is at the root of our twin crises of economic injustice and climate chaos. To survive as a species, and make our work lives more meaningful, we need to resist extraction, reduce consumption and build alternative institutions powered by renewable resources and freely associated labor."
