            <h2>The Beautiful Solutions Gallery and Lab</h2>
            <p>The Beautiful Solutions <a href="https://solutions.thischangeseverything.org/">Gallery</a> and <a href="https://solutions.thischangeseverything.org/#idealab/">Lab</a> is an interactive space for sharing the stories, solutions and big ideas needed to build new institutional power and point the way toward a just, resilient, and democratic future.</p>

            <p>Developed by <i>Beautiful Solutions</i> in partnership with <i><a href="http://thischangeseverything.org/">This Changes Everything</a></i>, this is an open-ended project that will continue to evolve based on the ideas you submit to the Lab, and the ongoing contributions of the thinkers and practitioners on the forefront of building alternatives.</p>
            <h2>Partnership with This Changes Everything</h2>
            <p>This exciting collaboration between <i>This Changes Everything</i> and <i>Beautiful Solutions</i> is a natural fit of aligned values and shared vision.</p>

            <p>As <i>This Changes Everything challenges</i> the dominant narrative on the climate crisis with its stark analysis of an economic system fundamentally opposed to a livable future, people inevitably ask, “What can we do?” “If capitalism can’t solve the climate crisis,” people are asking, “what is the alternative?”</p>

            <p>This is where the Beautiful Solutions Gallery and Lab come in. By shifting the focus to the transformative stories and ideas in practice all around the world, we hope to prove that not only is another world possible — but in fact, it’s already happening. We also aim to provide valuable resources and inspiration for activists and organizers on the frontlines of building an intersectional global movement for system change.</p>

            <h2>Beautiful Solutions</h2>
            <p>Resistance is essential, but it’s not enough. As we fight the injustice around us, we also have to imagine — and create — the world we want. We have to build real alternatives in the here and now — alternatives that are not only living proof that things can be done differently, but that actively challenge, and eventually supplant, the power of the status quo. Beautiful Solutions is an online platform, book, and training program that disseminates the most promising and contagious strategies for doing just that.</p>

            <p>Expanding on the model of its companion project <i>Beautiful Trouble: A Toolbox for Revolution</i>, <i>Beautiful Solutions</i> lays out an interconnected matrix of Solutions, Values, Theories and Stories designed to promote and support the development of participatory civic, cultural and financial institutions that build community wealth and ownership in a manner that is restorative to ecological and societal health.</p>

            <p>A comprehensive book version called <i>Beautiful Solutions: A Toolbox for the Future</i> is scheduled for Fall 2015.</p>
