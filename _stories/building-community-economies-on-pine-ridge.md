title: Building community economies on Pine Ridge
short_write_up: "The Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota has a rich legacy of struggle. It’s one of the poorest areas in the United States, but it is also the scene of exciting new developments in worker and community ownership. The Thunder Valley Community Development Corporation is building a net-zero “regenerative community” designed to sustainably produce all the energy it uses, managing their own construction to create both jobs and housing for the Oglala Lakota people. Elsewhere on Pine Ridge, Native-owned company Native American Natural is transitioning to employee ownership while bringing the buffalo back to Native lands. These developments signal a community taking charge of its own future."
