title: "Worker-Owned Rockaways Cooperatives"
short_write_up: "<p>In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy slammed into Far Rockaway, Queens, destroying entire city blocks and displacing thousands. As residents struggled to pick up the pieces, private developers began to close in on recently vacated properties. Their intentions were clear — to remake the Rockaways’ economy to maximize their own profit, forgoing local input. In response, local workers teamed up with The Working World and Occupy Sandy to create the Worker-Owned Rockaways Cooperatives (WORCs) program, which helps local residents build and finance their own worker-owned companies and establishes Rockaways residents as critical voices in determining their economic future. Two new cooperatives, Roca Mia Construction and La Mies Bakery, have already launched. Little by little, Worker-Owned Rockaways Cooperatives is planting the seeds for a new, community-led economy in the Rockaways.</p>"
