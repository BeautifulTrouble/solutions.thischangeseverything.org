title: "Trade School: barter-for-knowledge"
short_write_up: "<p>Trade School is an alternative, self-organized school that runs on barter and places equal value on big ideas, practical skills and experiential knowledge. Anyone can teach a class. Students sign up for a class by agreeing to bring a barter item that the teacher requests. Trade School is about building relationships of trust and mutual aid through the voluntary, reciprocal exchange of resources and service. The first Trade School opened in 2010 in New York City. Today, there is an international network of more than 50 local, self-organized chapters worldwide. The project is organized entirely by volunteer collectives, sharing skills to create spaces of hope amidst rising tuition costs and persistent unemployment.</p>"
