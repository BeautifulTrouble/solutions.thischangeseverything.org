title: "Vio.Me Occupied Factory"
short_write_up: "<p>When the Viomichaniki Metalleutiki (Vio.Me) building materials factory in Thessaloniki, Greece, was abandoned by its owners in May 2011, the workers decided to occupy it and resume production under workers&#8217; self-management, shifting the production towards ecologically non-harmful detergents. Now embroiled in a complex legal, political and economic struggle, the Vio.Me factory has turned into a symbol of creative popular resistance to destructive neoliberal policies and has spawned a wide and dedicated solidarity movement at a national and international level.</p>
