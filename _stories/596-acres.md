title: "596 Acres"
short_write_up: "<p>There are thousands of publicly owned vacant lots in the neighborhoods of New York City. These empty spaces fill with garbage and blight communities they could otherwise enliven. To address the issue, 596 Acres began a pilot project to help neighbors identify opportunities to transform fenced-in vacant lots into gardens, farms and play spaces. Through a crowd-sourced map and organizing support, 596 Acres has assisted 143 neighbor-led campaigns in turning 6.7 acres of vacant parcels of land into open community spaces; 26 campaigns have already been successful. Their experience has led to partnerships with advocates in other US cities, seeding three new projects in Philadelphia, New Orleans, and Los Angeles. With online tools and hands-on advocacy, 596 Acres is opening up the commons and creating spaces where people have the opportunity to rebuild their city together.</p>"
