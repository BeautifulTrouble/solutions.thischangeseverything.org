title: "Cowry Collective timebank"
short_write_up: "<p>The Cowry Collective Timebank is a people-of-color-led network engaged in reciprocal exchange of services, skills, and goods through timebanking , where the currency exchanged is the time spent by members. Through membership in the timebank, people create and strengthen community bonds, build economic freedom by providing an alternative means of meeting needs and desires, and encourage creativity in redefining self-sufficiency, interdependence and valuation of time. In St. Louis, the sixth most segregated city in the U.S., timebanking is a tool for addressing racial inequality and bridging racial divides through a process of community building that happens person by person, one hour at a time.</p>"
