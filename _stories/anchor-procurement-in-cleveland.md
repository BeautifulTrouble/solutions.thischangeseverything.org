title: Anchor procurement in Cleveland
short_write_up: "Cleveland’s “anchor procurement” strategy leverages public or nonprofit, place-based anchor institutions — such as universities, hospitals, and local government — to use their purchasing power to seed community and employee-owned businesses in low-income communities. The Evergreen Cooperatives network, founded in 2009, now employs 100 people in three businesses—a commercial-scale laundry, a 3.25-acre greenhouse, and a solar and energy service business. Many cities have since launched similar efforts. Anchor procurement can also help support existing local businesses. For example, between 2005 and 2010, local procurement by University Hospitals as part of its $1.2-billion “Vision 2010” construction project generated nearly 1,000 jobs for Cleveland residents.   "
