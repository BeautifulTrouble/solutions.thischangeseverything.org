title: "Cooperative Home Care Associates"
short_write_up: "<p>Started in the Bronx, Cooperative Home Care Associates (CHCA) is a worker-owned home healthcare agency that hires primarily unemployed and low-income women of color to serve as home care aides. The cooperative was founded on the premise that a worker-owned company that increases wages and benefits for its employees can provide better care to its clients, and is now the largest worker-owned co-op in the United States.
Cooperative Home Care Associates provides intensive training, full-time work, health insurance, overtime protection, union membership, and programming to its 2,300 employees/owners. Building on the success of CHCA and other worker co-ops in the city, New York City recently allocated $1.2 million to fund the development of worker cooperatives.</p>"
