title: "Brazilian Landless Workers&#8217; Movement"
short_write_up: "<p>The Landless Workers&#8217; Movement (MST) of Brazil is the hemisphere’s largest social movement organization, claiming 1.5 million members. In the thirty years since their founding, the MST has developed a practice of study, action, and reflection. They focus on agrarian reform and force the issue by occupying land they believe should be redistributed by law. </p>
<p>Once established on the land, MST members start schools, build homes, and grow crops. The MST adds value to the produce of members through the packaging and marketing of their goods, including clothing, essential oils and roasted coffee. Though they push the state to act, they maintain autonomy from the state and political parties, all while building their own powers of production, control of land, and freedom from agribusiness. Most recently, they have launched an effort to rewrite the constitution, believing that systemic change is impossible under the current constitution.</p>"
