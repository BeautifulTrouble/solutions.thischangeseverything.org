title: "REPOWERBalcombe"
short_write_up: "<p><em>Excerpted from</em> This Changes Everything.</p>
<p>After the British village of Balcombe in West Sussex was the site of huge anti-fracking protests and angry clashes in 2013, a new power company formed called REPOWERBalcombe. Its goal is ‘to supply the equivalent of 100% of Balcombe’s electricity demand through community owned, locally generated renewable energy’ — with financing coming from residents buying shares in the energy cooperative. The fracking fight continues to play out in the courts, but solar panels are already on their way and residents who were originally in favor of oil and gas drilling are joining the co-op, attracted to the promise of self-sufficiency and cost-saving.</p>"
