title: "Chitsvachirimurutsoka Cooperative, Zimbabwe"
short_write_up: "<p>Twenty-two veterans of Zimbabwe’s war of liberation came together after independence and pooled their demobilization allowances to form a collective co-operative farm – jointly owned and democratically run. On the Chitsvachirimurutsoka (meaning nothing ventured nothing gained) farm, members supported themselves on crop and livestock production, including poultry and cattle slaughtering, processing, packaging and marketing. Other activities included garment making and a kitchen, bar and childcare facility on the premises. </p>
<p>Seeing the success of the first cooperatives in the early 1980s, many other people decided to form their own co-operatives in the communities, districts and provinces, until cooperatives could be found throughout the country. In keeping with one of the international co-operative principles, “co-operation among co-operatives,” co-operatives started to organize themselves at the district level, where they come together to share information, ideas, experiences and resources, including a revolving loan fund, a machinery pool, and bulk buying and marketing arrangements. The same was done at the provincial and national level, where transport, group insurance, standard bookkeeping, accounting and audit were established to assist the members and their initiatives. Though later economic and political crises would hit the cooperative movement hard, these early advances stand as a democratic and grassroots model of development.</p>"
