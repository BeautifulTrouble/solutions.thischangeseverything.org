title: "Boulder, Colorado, vs. Xcel Energy"
short_write_up: "<p><em>Adapted from</em> This Changes Everything.</p>
<p>In the mid-2000s, residents and local officials in the liberal city of Boulder, Colorado, began lobbying their privatized power utility to move away from coal and toward renewable energy. The company, the Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy, wasn&#8217;t particularly interested, so a coalition of environmentalists and an energetic youth group called New Era Colorado came to the conclusion that they had to take their grid back. Steve Fenberg of New Era explains, &#8216;We have one of the most carbon-intensive energy supplies in the country, and [Boulder] is an environmentally minded community, and we wanted to change that. We realized that we had no control over that unless we controlled the energy supply.&#8217;</p>
<p>In 2011, despite being outspent by Xcel by ten to one, the pro-renewables coalition narrowly won two ballot measures that called on the city of Boulder to consider buying back its power system. The vote did not immediately put the power utility under public control, but it gave the city the authority and financing to seriously consider the option (which it is currently doing). The coalition won another crucial vote in 2013 against an Xcel-supported initiative that would have blocked the formation of a new public utility,this time by a wide majority.</p>
<p>These were historic votes: other cities had reversed earlier privatizations because they were unhappy with the quality of the service or the pricing under the private operator. But this was the first time a U.S. city was taking these steps &#8216;for the sole purpose of reducing its impact on the planet,&#8217; according to Tim Hillman, a Boulder-based environmental engineer. Indeed, the pro-public forces had put fighting climate change front and centre in their campaigns, accusing Xcel of being just another fossil fuel company standing in the way of much needed climate action. And according to Fenberg, their vision reaches beyond Boulder. &#8216;We want to show the world that you can actually power a city responsibly and not pay a lot for it,&#8217; he now says. &#8216;We want this to be a model, not just do this one cool thing for ourselves in the community.&#8217;</p>"
