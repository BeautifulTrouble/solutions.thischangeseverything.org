title: "Non-extractive financial cooperative"
short_write_up: "A non-extractive financial cooperative is owned and operated by its members—the loan or equity recipients. Unlike most banks, its mission is not to extract profit from the community, but rather to leave more value in a community than it took out. For instance, it might provide the capital and technical assistance a community business needs to transition to community ownership. Rather than dictating the terms of investment, a non-extractive financial cooperative makes sure these terms are set by the people and communities involved. It inverts the power of capital, turning money into a tool for people—rather than the other way around."
