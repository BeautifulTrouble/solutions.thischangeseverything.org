title: Pluralist commonwealth
short_write_up: "If we don’t want corporate capitalism, and we don’t want authoritarian state socialism, what do we want? The pluralist commonwealth is a vision of an economic and political system designed to ensure environmental sustainability, genuine democracy, community, and greater equality and personal liberty. Crucially: it’s a commonwealth, meaning that ownership of the economic foundations of society is broadly distributed and democratized, and it’s pluralist, meaning that there is no single magic bullet; instead, we need a system made up of different kinds of institutions at different scales, from worker cooperatives and community ownership at smaller scales to public ownership in critically important larger sectors."
