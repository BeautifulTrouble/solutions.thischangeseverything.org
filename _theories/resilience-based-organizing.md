title: "Resilience-based organizing"
short_write_up: "<p>Resilience-based organizing is a movement-building strategy that focuses on improving the ability of communities to meet their needs through shared work, democratic self-governance, and contesting power. The approach departs from traditional campaign-based organizing approaches in which communities pressure a political figure with decision-making power to act on their demands, thereby re-enforcing existing structures of power. Instead, people organize to create visionary and oppositional economies in ways that strengthen community control and are ecologically regenerative. Resilience-based organizing was foundational to black liberation movements such as the Black Panther Party, which had more than sixty &#8216;self help&#8217; programs. We see it applied today in Zapatista communities and through the Landless Workers’ Movement in Brazil.</p>"
