title: "The missing middle"
short_write_up: "<p>Without access to capital or markets for their crops, millions of small farmers in the developing world are trapped in a cycle of poverty. Small businesses, nonprofits and cooperatives that connect producers and consumers are often too big for microfinance but too small or risky for conventional banks — they are in “the missing middle” of developing world finance. A number of innovative efforts — the nonprofit social investment fund Root Capital, out of Cambridge, MA, for example — are stepping into that missing middle, growing rural prosperity in poor, ecologically vulnerable places by lending capital, delivering financial training, and strengthening market connections for rural businesses.</p>"
