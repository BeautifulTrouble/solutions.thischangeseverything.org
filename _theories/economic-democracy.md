title: "Economic democracy"
short_write_up: "<p>Economic democracy is an emerging framework for a new solidarity economy that prioritizes people and planet over private profits. As an alternative to capitalism and state socialism, economic democracy asserts the rights of communities to establish a basic standard of living, and to use their collective resources to achieve that standard. The “invisible hand” is replaced by community-based processes to steward capital, land and labor. Economic democracy establishes the right of popular planning as a foundation for a new economy created by the people, for the people. Worker-owned co-ops, community land trusts, participatory budgeting, and community credit unions are examples of economic democracy at a local level.</p>"
