title: "Horizontalism"
short_write_up: "<p>Horizontalism (horizontalidad) was first used to describe the relationships that emerged in Argentina after the 2001 economic crisis. In Argentina, as in Greece and Spain more recently, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets and began self-organizing: forming neighborhood assemblies, occupying and re-opening shuttered workplaces, and setting up massive barter networks. Horizontalism became one of the main ways people described what they were doing: building relationships grounded in equality, autonomy and respect, with no one having power over another. While horizontalism implies the use of direct democracy, it does not necessitate the use of any one form of decision making. The goal is to be flexible and responsive, so that all voices are heard and empowering relationships are created.</p>"
