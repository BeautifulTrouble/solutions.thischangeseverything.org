title: Buen vivir
short_write_up: "Buen vivir (living well, or living well together) is an indigenous Latin American term describing alternatives to development rooted in community, ecology, culture, and a spiritual connection to the land. The concept is radically different from the modern economistic view: whereas homo economicus sees nature as a resource to be exploited, even destroyed, for profit, the convivial buenviviente sees other species, as well as forests and rivers, as having the same rights to prosper that she does. The concept has been taken up by social movements and progressive governments across the Americas, serving as a philosophical and cosmological foundation for developing new and better ways of living well together."
