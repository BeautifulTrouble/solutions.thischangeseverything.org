title: "Solidarity economics"
short_write_up: "<p>Solidarity economics is a tradition of radical economic theory and organizing practice that originated in Latin America in the mid 1980s. Embracing a belief that people are deeply creative and capable of developing their own solutions, it rejects one-size-fits-all economic blueprints and instead seeks to identify existing diverse instances of liberatory livelihood practice, linking them together in mutually supportive networks. Solidarity economics draws on elements from utopian socialism, anarchism, non-statist Marxism, cooperativism, and pedagogy for liberation. It proposes that instead of “waiting for the revolution,” we can do this work now, building “solidarity chains” linking value-resonant livelihood practices — simultaneously challenging our dependence on exploitative economic relations while replacing them with forms of creative solidarity.</p>"
