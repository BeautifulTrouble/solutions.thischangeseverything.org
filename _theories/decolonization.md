title: "Decolonization"
short_write_up: "<p>Colonization is an historical and ongoing form of territorial, economic, and mental conquest wherein one group of indigenous people (first inhabitants of a place) is subordinated and put in service to another group of people under the system of imperialism. Decolonization is a set of ideas and lived experiences that challenge imperialism — a form of bottom-up disobedience to colonization. Theories and enactments of decolonization prioritize indigenous (non-Western) forms of knowledge, spirituality, cultural practices, and sovereignty. Decolonization theory raises questions about working with or without the “master’s tools” to envision alternatives to imperialism’s constellations of power.</p>"
