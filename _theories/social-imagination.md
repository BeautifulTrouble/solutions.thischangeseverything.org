title: Social imagination
short_write_up: "Philosopher Maxine Greene describes social imagination as the ability to “look at the world as if it could be otherwise.” It is the capacity, both creative and moral, to envision alternative possibilities for our communities and our world. The social imagination makes social change possible because an understanding of what might be gives us a perspective from which to challenge things as they are, as well as the hope and determination we need to build something different. To develop our social imaginations is to become more “wide-awake” to injustice in the world, a vital first step in inspiring us to change it."
