title: "Maximum wage"
short_write_up: "<p>A maximum wage is effectively a 100% tax on all income above a certain amount. This is far from a novel idea, having been instituted or proposed using a range of mechanisms and in contexts as diverse as revolutionary Russia and WWII wartime USA. One proposal circulating in the US in recent years is to levy a 100% income tax rate on incomes that exceed a ratio of the federal minimum wage. So if the minimum wage is $10 an hour, a maximum wage could be tied to, say, 50 times the minimum wage. In this scenario, all income above $1.04 million per year, would be taxed at 100%. Effectively, no one would make more than a million dollars per year. Who needs more than that anyway?</p>"
