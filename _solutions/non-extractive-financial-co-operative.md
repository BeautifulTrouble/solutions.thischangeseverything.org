title: Non-extractive financial co-operative
short_write_up: "A non-extractive financial cooperative is owned and operated by its members — the loan or equity recipients. Unlike most banks, its mission is not to extract profit from the community, but to leave more value in a community than it took out. For instance, it might provide the capital and technical assistance a small business needs to transition to community ownership. Rather than dictating the terms of investment, a non-extractive financial cooperative makes sure the terms are set by the people and communities involved. It thus inverts the power of capital, turning money into a tool for people — rather than the other way around."
