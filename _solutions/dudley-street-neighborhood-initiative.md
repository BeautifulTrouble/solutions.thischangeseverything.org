title: "Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative"
short_write_up: "Decades of redlining, arson, and “urban renewal” had left 30 percent of the land in the Dudley neighborhood of Boston vacant. In response, residents formed the Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative and launched a grassroots, community-controlled planning effort. They reclaimed land from absentee landowners and produced a Declaration of Community Rights, stating that, “We, the residents of the Dudley area, have the right to participate in all planning, programs, and policies affecting our lives.”  This ongoing effort has led to the creation of hundreds of units of affordable housing along with schools, parks, gardens, and other public spaces."
