title: "Climate risk bonds"
short_write_up: "<p>Climate risk bonds are tools that governments can use to internalize the social costs of carbon emissions at the point of extraction — and a good way for communities to implement the ‘polluter pays’ principle in their dealings with energy companies. Bonding requirements — an insurance agreement that guarantees public compensation for any financial loss suffered because of a project — are nothing new when it comes to regulating risky industries. They already exist to cover public expenses that may arise when corporations abandon infrastructure or experience catastrophic industrial accidents. Climate risk bonds can be used to help governments at every level cover the expense of adaptation and climate disaster response. If new oil, gas, or coal projects are going to be approved, the least that governments can do is make sure they’re accounting for the long-term ecological risks by requiring climate risk bonds.</p>"
