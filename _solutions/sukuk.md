title: Sukuk
short_write_up: "Guided by the Islamic prohibition on making money from money, some Muslims have devised financial arrangements that allow for productive investment while still promoting community welfare and shared fate. Sukuk are the Islamic equivalent of bonds, but with a crucial difference: rather than being guaranteed a certain return and paid interest, participants become partial owners of the venture in which they invest, sharing in potential profits and in the risk of loss. Investors have every incentive to support worthy projects - “shorting” won’t work here. Sukuk funds can be implemented quickly and at scale, and are already run by banks and national governments around the world. Activists can push to introduce them in non-Muslim contexts, and to ensure that existing sukuk funds adhere to the original value of social justice that motivated their invention. "
