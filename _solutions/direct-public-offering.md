title: "Direct Public Offering"
short_write_up: "<p>One of the primary hurdles worker cooperatives encounter is access to capital. Those without cash or collateral simply cannot obtain traditional loans, and venture capitalists looking for big profits and a quick exit will not consider supporting a co-op because their investment won’t come with control of the company. A Direct Public Offering (DPO) is one way for businesses to raise money by selling stock to ordinary people, not just accredited investors. A DPO allows a business to have more control over the terms and to advertise the offering publicly, increasing the pool of investors exponentially! For the business, a DPO provides the “patient” capital it needs to start-up, expand or weather a storm. For the investor, a DPO can bring the potential for annual dividends and the ability to directly support community enterprise.</p>"
