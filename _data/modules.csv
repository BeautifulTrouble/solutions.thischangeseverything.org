a16E0000002QGCU,Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative,Story,"Decades of redlining, arson, and sham “urban renewal” efforts in the latter half of the twentieth century left 30 percent of the land in the Dudley neighborhood of Boston vacant. In response, residents started the Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative and launched a grassroots, community-controlled planning effort. Their Declaration of Community Rights states that residents, “have the right to participate in all planning, programs, and policies affecting our lives.” This ongoing effort has reclaimed land from absentee landlords — through a Community Land Trust with the power of eminent domain — and created hundreds of units of affordable housing, along with schools, parks, gardens, and other public spaces.","Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative

a16E0000002QHS9,Initiative 136,Story,"When the Greek government announced the sale of Thessaloniki’s state-managed water company in 2011, activists from the occupied squares joined the water workers to propose an alternative to both private and state management. The resulting campaign, Initiative 136, proposes the democratic, transparent and environmentally responsible management of water by local non-profit cooperatives. Its main premise is that 136 euros contributed by each household would be enough to ensure true common ownership of this vital good. 
In May 2014, this campaign was the driving force behind a grassroots referendum where 98 percent of the voters rejected water privatization. Massive popular opposition and a Supreme Court decision have since obliged the government to freeze the privatization process. This, however, is only a partial victory; Initiative 136 continues organizing to make social control of water a reality.","Κίνηση 136

a16E0000002QHSA,Basic income,Solution,"A basic income (a.k.a. guaranteed income or social wage) is a policy that’s useful for furthering so many critical projects that it is often called a “non-reformist reform.” Were the government to distribute an unconditional income sufficient for subsistence to every permanent resident, it would mitigate poverty, empower women, increase workers’ leverage in labor conflicts, provide people with the resources they need to participate in political and cultural life, and counteract the ecologically disastrous market imperative to incessantly extract, produce, and consume. Though this measure may sound idealistic, we know it can work: among other examples around the globe, Alaskans receive a small, variable guaranteed income.","Basic Income News

a16E0000002QHSB,Re-municipalization,Solution,"Re-municipalization refers to efforts by citizens to reverse the privatization of local services. It is most closely associated with movements to return local water services to public control, but can also include other important local services such as waste management, recycling, and energy generation. Significant examples of re-municipalization include cities like Paris and Buenos Aires, where previous private control of local water by transnationals Suez and Veolia resulted in soaring water fees, reduced access, crumbling infrastructure and poorer water quality. Re-municipalization represents an important challenge to neoliberalism because it repudiates the supposed superiority of private ownership and control of public goods, and shows that public utilities lost to privatization can, with concerted citizen action, be reclaimed.","Re-municipalization: Putting water back into public hands

a16E0000002QHSC,Solidarity economics,Theory,"Solidarity economics is a tradition of radical economic theory and organizing practice that originated in Latin America in the mid 1980s. Embracing a belief that people are deeply creative and capable of developing their own solutions, it rejects one-size-fits-all economic blueprints and instead seeks to identify existing diverse instances of liberatory livelihood practice, linking them together in mutually supportive networks. Solidarity economics draws on elements from utopian socialism, anarchism, non-statist Marxism, cooperativism, and pedagogy for liberation. It proposes that instead of “waiting for the revolution,” we can do this work now, building “solidarity chains” linking value-resonant livelihood practices — simultaneously challenging our dependence on exploitative economic relations while replacing them with forms of creative solidarity.","Solidarity Economics: Strategies for Building New Economies

a16E0000002QHSD,Comunalidad,Theory,"Comunalidad is an ever-evolving framework, a dialogue between the lived experience of pueblos in Mesoamerica and indigenous anthropologists naming and describing this worldview and perspective. The theory centers around four pillars of communal life: communal authority and governance via the popular assembly; communal territory, or land held in common; communal celebration, or feast days; and communal work for the benefit of the whole. For activists today, living models of self-governing community are potentially valuable, as well as paradoxical and sometimes difficult to imagine applied in Western contexts of the Global North. Given that comunalidad is deeply woven into place itself, uprooting the theory without this grounded connection poses serious challenges.","Defying Inequality by Fortifying Communal Life

a16E0000002QHSE,Usufruct,Theory,"Usufruct is the right to use and enjoy the “fruits” of a given resource, as long as the resource itself is preserved. The term comes from Roman property law, but is also used to describe ancient and Indigenous land-use paradigms in which land is held in common while individuals retain the right to hunt, fish, garden, or otherwise use the land sustainably. Usufruct is a key tenet of commons economies, offering a more just and sustainable alternative to private ownership. It is a recognition that we do not own the land and its resources — we are stewards, maintaining and improving our world for future generations.","The Commons in History: Culture, Conflict, and Ecology

A society that cultivates abundance does not treat human needs as something to be bought and sold, resists a culture that uses the perception of scarcity to obscure problems of distribution and discourage generosity, restores sovereignty, and operates on principles of solidarity and mutual aid.",,Beautiful Solutions,,Anchor procurement in Cleveland; Building community economies on Pine Ridge; Cooperative Homecare Associates; Cowry Collective timebank; Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative; Factor E Farm; Greenwave's restorative ocean farming; Initiative 136; Marinaleda's direct action economy; The Media Co-op; Thessaloniki's social solidarity clinic; The Zapatista Little School,Basic income; Maximum wage; Non-extractive financial cooperative; Public ownership; Re-municipalization; Sukuk; Timebanking,Buen vivir; Comunalidad; Horizontalism; Pluralist commonwealth; Social imagination; Solidarity economics; Stewardship; The commons; The missing middle; Usufruct; Zakat,agriculture; community development; cooperatives; democracy; energy; equity; financing; food; indigenous rights; justice; land use; movement building; racial justice; resource use; stewardship,,,,,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_YI65DeAxc_bXd2bmNEX2dod2M/edit?usp=sharing,Value-Cultivates-Abundance.jpg,,,,

a16E0000002QIjP,Alaska Permanent Fund,Story,"For more than thirty years, all residents of Alaska have received yearly dividends from an entity called the Alaska Permanent Fund. Revenue comes from each Alaskan’s claim on the oil wealth extracted by the publicly owned North Slope oil fields. These dividends have ranged from about $1,000 per person per year to over $3,000. Since children are included, a dividend of $2,000 boosts a family of four’s income by $8,000. While it doesn’t do anything to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, the Fund does prove that a basic income program is both possible and popular: even conservative Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin expanded the levy.","The Alaska Model

a16E0000002QIjQ,Direct Public Offering,Solution,"One of the primary hurdles worker cooperatives encounter is access to capital. Those without cash or collateral simply cannot obtain traditional loans, and venture capitalists looking for big profits and a quick exit will not consider supporting a co-op because their investment won’t come with control of the company. A Direct Public Offering (DPO) is one way for businesses to raise money by selling stock to ordinary people, not just accredited investors. A DPO allows a business to have more control over the terms and to advertise the offering publicly, increasing the pool of investors exponentially! For the business, a DPO provides the “patient” capital it needs to start-up, expand or weather a storm. For the investor, a DPO can bring the potential for annual dividends and the ability to directly support community enterprise.","Direct Public Offering resources

a16E0000002QIjR,Timebanking,Solution,"Timebanking is a way to formalize the exchange of skills and favors while building circles of trust and reciprocity. For every hour you spend doing a favor for someone in the time bank, you earn one time credit, which can then be spent receiving a favor from someone else participating in the timebank. Everyone’s time is valued equally, meaning those whose time is undervalued by the monetary economy (childcare workers, for example) do proportionally better. Examples of exchanges include language lessons, car rides, moving assistance, massage, gardening, web design and music lessons. Time credits may be tracked in an online database, a notebook, or a paper scrip.","Timebanking UK

a16E0000002QIjS,Public ownership,Solution,"Public ownership is when a municipality, state, nation, or other public body controls and derives benefit from an enterprise or resource. It is a means of ensuring and enhancing community control of the socio-economic decisions that affect local lives and livelihoods. By providing democratic accountability over economically important institutions and enterprises, public ownership can fulfill a variety of objectives, including: increasing public revenues, improving and expanding service, reducing costs for users, providing stable employment, and achieving environmentally sustainable growth or stasis. There are real-world contemporary and historical examples of highly successful public ownership in virtually every economic sector and in cultures and nations across the world.","Rethinking Public Ownership: Making Space for Economic Democracy

a16E0000002QIjT,Maximum wage,Solution,"A maximum wage is effectively a 100 percent tax on all income above a certain amount. This is far from a novel idea, having been instituted or proposed using a range of mechanisms and in contexts as diverse as revolutionary Russia and WWII wartime US. One proposal circulating in the US in recent years is to levy a 100 percent income tax rate on incomes that exceed a ratio of the federal minimum wage. So if the minimum wage is $10 an hour, a maximum wage could be tied to, say, 50 times the minimum wage. In this scenario, all income above $1.04 million per year, would be taxed at 100 percent. Effectively, no one would make more than a million dollars per year. Who needs more than that anyway?","The Maximum Wage by Sam Pizzigati

a16E0000002QIjU,Zakat,Theory,"In the Islamic tradition, zakat is the mandatory gifting of a portion of one’s income and wealth to poorer citizens, debtors, the enslaved, those struggling for justice, and those far from home. Over centuries, zakat has been reduced to depoliticized charity, often at the expense of the principle’s fundamental point: we all have real claims on one another. The poor have some right to what we think of as the property of the rich. Immigrants have a right to a compassionate welcome. We need not devise new principles, or export Western ones, in our search for alternatives: the values that will support sustainable societies already exist all over the world. What we need to do is reclaim them.","Zakat: Drawing Insights for Legal Theory and Economic Policy

a16E0000002QIjV,Horizontalism,Theory,"Horizontalism (horizontalidad) was first used to describe the relationships that emerged in Argentina after the 2001 economic crisis. In Argentina, as in Greece and Spain more recently, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets and began self-organizing: forming neighborhood assemblies, occupying and re-opening shuttered workplaces, and setting up massive barter networks. Horizontalism became one of the main ways people described what they were doing: building relationships grounded in equality, autonomy and respect, with no one having power over another. While horizontalism implies the use of direct democracy, it does not necessitate the use of any one form of decision making. The goal is to be flexible and responsive, so that all voices are heard and empowering relationships are created.","Horizontalism: Voices of Popular Power in Argentina

These communities have resisted such encroachments, fighting not just to defend common control of land, housing, healthcare, human knowledge, and other vital spheres that shape our daily lives, but to extend those commons.

These empty spaces fill with garbage and blight communities they could otherwise enliven. To address the issue, 596 Acres began a pilot project to help neighbors identify opportunities to transform fenced-in vacant lots into gardens, farms and play spaces. Through a crowd-sourced map and organizing support, 596 Acres has assisted 143 neighbor-led campaigns in turning 6.7 acres of vacant parcels of land into open community spaces; 26 campaigns have already been successful. Their experience has led to partnerships with advocates in other US cities, seeding three new projects in Philadelphia, New Orleans, and Los Angeles. With online tools and hands-on advocacy, 596 Acres is opening up the commons and creating spaces where people have the opportunity to rebuild their city together.","596 Acres

a16E0000002Qf84,Recuperated workplaces,Solution,"Occupy, Resist, Produce! This slogan, borrowed from the landless movement in Brazil, summarizes how workers around the world, beginning in Argentina, have been taking back their lives and their work. Instead of accepting unemployment due to workplace closure, workers form horizontal assemblies and “recuperate” (take back) their workplace, resist eviction, and begin producing again. Many recuperated workplaces organize horizontally and with equal remuneration. This phenomenon has been spreading, from the South to the North, with recent recuperations in Greece, Italy and France.","The Take

a16E0000002Qf8d,Community land trust,Solution,"A community land trust is a form of collective land ownership that prioritizes community uses of the land, promoting affordable and cooperative housing, sustainable agriculture, and other uses not fully valued by the market. Community land trusts are nonprofits that typically have a three-part board, representing leaseholders, the surrounding community, and the broader public interest. The trust owns and stewards the land in perpetuity and leases the land to homeowners, farmers, and businesses, who must comply with terms set by the community land trust, such as preserving affordability. The first community land trust was established in 1969 in Georgia to secure land for black farmers; there are now almost 250 land trusts in nearly every U.S. state, and many more around the world.","Community Land Trust resources and links

Decolonization is a set of ideas and lived experiences that challenge imperialism — a form of bottom-up disobedience to colonization. Theories and enactments of decolonization prioritize indigenous (non-Western) forms of knowledge, spirituality, cultural practices, and sovereignty.

a16E0000002QfAF,Participatory democracy,Theory,"Participatory democracy is a system that facilitates the active involvement of individuals in all important decisions and institutions affecting their lives. In contrast to traditional representative democracy, which prescribes a relatively limited set of roles for individuals in political life (e.g. voting, writing to politicians), participatory democracy embraces social movements and other forms of collective action as vital forms of political change. Participatory democracy does not confine itself to the formal political realm, instead calling for broad inclusion in all of society’s institutions, including families, schools, businesses, and the media. Rather than being a static system, participatory democracy is a constant process of contention and transformation.","Participatory Democracy from Port Huron to Occupy

Four years later, the same workers made another transformative move. Partnering with a grassroots cooperative financial organization, The Working World, the workers bought out their old factory and began making windows under democratic worker-control and a new name: New Era Windows Cooperative.

In the thirty years since their founding, the MST has developed a practice of study, action, and reflection. They focus on agrarian reform and force the issue by occupying land they believe should be redistributed by law. 
Once established on the land, MST members start schools, build homes, and grow crops. The MST adds value to the produce of members through the packaging and marketing of the goods they produce, including clothing, essential oils and roasted coffee. Though they push the state to act, they maintain autonomy from the state and political parties, all while building their own powers of production, control of land, and freedom from agribusiness.

a16E0000002QexX,Wage ratio,Solution,"Some businesses, as a matter of good governance, adopt wage ratios linking highest and lowest salaries. For many years, Ben & Jerry’s ice cream retained a six-to-one ratio between CEO and lowest paid employee. The seventh largest enterprise in Spain, Mondragon, maintains a 5:1 average ratio across its companies. For comparison, the average ratio in the United States is 231:1. Wage ratios are more than a number; they reflect deeply held beliefs about the value of different kinds of work.
At the national level, the tax system could encourage wage ratios by denying corporations the ability to deduct CEO pay that exceeds a specific ratio or dollar amount, whichever is higher. In the US, such caps were applied to financial bailout recipient firms and will be applied to health insurance companies under Obama’s healthcare reform legislation. Wage ratios, whether at the enterprise or national level, are a potentially powerful mechanism for reigning in growing wage disparities.","Executive Excess

a16E0000002Qet1,Worker-Owned Rockaways Cooperatives,Story,"In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy slammed into Far Rockaway, Queens, destroying entire city blocks and displacing thousands. As residents struggled to pick up the pieces, private developers began to close in on recently vacated properties. Their intentions were clear — to remake the Rockaways’ economy to maximize their own profit, forgoing local input. In response, local workers teamed up with The Working World and Occupy Sandy to create the Worker-Owned Rockaways Cooperatives (WORCs) program, which helps local residents build and finance their own worker-owned companies and establishes Rockaways residents as critical voices in determining their economic future. Two new cooperatives, Roca Mia Construction and La Mies Bakery, have already launched. Little by little, Worker-Owned Rockaways Cooperatives is planting the seeds for a new, community-led economy in the Rockaways.","A Co-op Story: People's Construction in Rockaway

a16E0000002QfB4,Resilience-based organizing,Theory,"Resilience-based organizing is a movement-building strategy that focuses on improving the ability of communities to meet their needs through shared work, democratic self-governance, and contesting power. The approach departs from traditional campaign-based organizing approaches in which communities pressure a political figure with decision-making power to act on their demands, thereby re-enforcing existing structures of power. Instead, people organize to create visionary and oppositional economies in ways that strengthen community control and are ecologically regenerative. Resilience-based organizing was foundational to black liberation movements such as the Black Panther Party, which had more than sixty 'self help' programs. We see it applied today in Zapatista communities and through the Landless Workers’ Movement in Brazil.","Movement Generation Justice & Ecology Project

Using popular education techniques, the traffic mimes fanned out through the city, mocking lawbreakers, applauding courteous drivers, and dramatizing the frustrations and challenges of citizens moving through traffic. The result: a 50 percent drop in traffic fatalities, reduced traffic gridlock, and a marked shift in the traffic culture of the city.","Academic turns city into a social experiment

This legal victory means that the river now enjoys the same rights and responsibilities before the law as people (and corporations!). The New Zealand government has officially recognised the river as a source of great physical and spiritual sustenance to the people who live alongside it. This precedent-setting legal case is the first time the rights of a river have been guaranteed in this way, opening up exciting possibilities for protecting, and changing how we understand our relationship with, the natural world.","An indivisible and living whole

The social imagination makes social change possible because an understanding of what might be gives us a perspective from which to challenge things as they are, as well as the hope and determination we need to build something different. To develop our social imaginations is to become more “wide-awake” to injustice in the world, a vital first step in inspiring us to change it.","The Maxinne Green Center

The lesson is clear: to improve our health and wellbeing, we need to move beyond reactive healthcare and focus on the “upstream” factors — or social determinants — that most impact our health: income and its distribution, education, housing, nutrition, employment and the wider environment. Upstream thinking means taking wise collective action to ensure better outcomes rather than simply responding to, and being overwhelmed by, crises we could have foreseen.","Investigating the root causes of the global health crisis

Labor leader and organizer Cesar Chavez argued for the community to start their own credit union. Pooling their resources allowed workers to meet their financial needs and support the movement during the winter months, making it easier to strike in the summer. Six years after its founding, the Farm Workers Credit Union had loaned $183,000 to 874 members. ","Farm Worker Credit Union (essay & photos)

Whether it’s workers organizing to take over a shuttered factory, landless peasants squatting and farming on fallow land, or a neighborhood assembly deciding how their share of the city budget will be allocated, people are working together in countless ways to bring about a truly democratic world.

The Peer Production License (PPL), proposed by “venture communist” Dmytri Kleiner, is a reciprocity-based license by which commons are freely accessible to those who contribute to create them, while entities profiting from these commons without contributing are charged license fees. It helps protect digital, natural and biological resources such as software, seeds, plants and ancestral knowledge against the danger of privatization, while enabling their wider use. When paired with open-source producer cooperative models, the PPL can resist extractive global supply chains by supporting a reciprocal economy based on local industry and sustainable community sourcing, using open hardware designs and combined know-how.","Capital for the Commons

a16E0000002QA2Z,Housing cooperative,Solution,"Housing cooperatives are jointly owned residential properties, held in common by the residents. Residents purchase shares in the cooperative and divide responsibility for the upkeep and management of the building or buildings, often run using principles of democratic decision-making. Many cooperatives are designed as affordable housing, with residents receiving limited equity in order to maintain a low cost of membership. Other benefits to cooperative living can include environmental sustainability, self-determination, and strong, supportive communities. In fact, some cooperatives are designed as “intentional communities” based around shared values and goals, such as the seven cooperative principles (see “Learn more” links below).","Fellowship for Intentional Community

a16E0000002QA2F,Buen vivir,Theory,"Buen vivir (living well, or living well together) is an indigenous Latin American term describing alternatives to development rooted in community, ecology, culture, and a spiritual connection to the land. The concept is radically different from the modern economistic view: whereas homo economicus sees nature as a resource to be exploited, even destroyed, for profit, the convivial buenviviente sees other species, as well as forests and rivers, as having the same rights to prosper that she does. The concept has been taken up by social movements and progressive governments across the Americas, serving as a philosophical and cosmological foundation for developing new and better ways of living well together.","The Social Philosophy Inspiring Movements in South America

a16E0000002QA2A,The commons,Theory,"In pre-capitalist times, shared commons were the source of sustenance for most people. Though corporations have now privatized and depleted much of the commons, it lives on in three portfolios: natural wealth (air, water, seeds, ecosystems, other species); community wealth (streets, parks, the Internet, money, social insur­ance); and cultural wealth (music, art, science, open-source software). All of these are gifts we share and are obliged to preserve for others and for future generations.
	
Here’s the rub: under capitalism, common wealth is increasingly appro­­priated by private corporations and wealthy individuals for profit . To counter this, we need to expand and strengthen both the com­mons and the institu­tions that sustain them.","Capitalism 3.0: A Guide to Reclaiming the Commons

a16E0000002QA2P,The missing middle,Theory,"Without access to capital or markets for their crops, millions of small farmers in the developing world are trapped in a cycle of poverty. Small businesses, nonprofits and cooperatives that connect producers and consumers are often too big for microfinance but too small or risky for conventional banks — they are in “the missing middle” of developing world finance. A number of innovative efforts — the nonprofit social investment fund Root Capital, out of Cambridge, MA, for example — are stepping into that missing middle, growing rural prosperity in poor, ecologically vulnerable places by lending capital, delivering financial training, and strengthening market connections for rural businesses.","Root Capital

a16E0000002QA2o,Community wealth building,Solution,"In communities around the world, people have responded to economic pain, growing wealth inequality and neighborhood disinvestment by experimenting with new economic institutions and approaches, including cooperatives, worker-owned firms, non-profit neighborhood corporations, social enterprises, community-based financial institutions, land trusts, and municipal ownership. This is community wealth building, a fast-growing economic development model and movement that strengthens our communities through democratic ownership and control of business and jobs. Community wealth building builds on local talents, capacities, facilities, capital and financial flows to develop locally owned — and often community-owned — businesses that are anchored in place and can sustain the local economy for the long haul.","Community-Wealth.org

a16E0000002QA38,Sukuk,Solution,"Guided by the Islamic prohibition on making money from money, some Muslims have devised financial arrangements that allow for productive investment while still promoting community welfare and shared fate. Sukuk are the Islamic equivalent of bonds, but with a crucial difference: rather than being guaranteed a certain return and paid interest, participants become partial owners of the venture in which they invest, sharing in potential profits and in the risk of loss. Investors have every incentive to support worthy projects  —  “shorting” won’t work here. Sukuk funds can be implemented quickly and at scale, and are already run by banks and national governments around the world. Activists can push to introduce them in non-Muslim contexts, and to ensure that existing sukuk funds adhere to the original value of social justice that motivated their invention. ","Islamic Development Bank: What is Sukuk?

a16E0000002QA2e,Stewardship,Theory,"Diverse cultural and faith traditions teach us that no human ownership is truly absolute. Any control we have over the assets of this planet may be a gift from God, nature, or our ancestors, but one thing is for sure: our dominion is only temporary. Others bequeathed us these assets, and others will depend upon them after we are gone. Stewardship, as opposed to ownership, embraces this reality. Whereas ownership suggests a right to do as we please, stewardship emphasizes our responsibility to protect, cultivate, and serve that which nourishes us. As such, the concept of stewardship forms a solid foundation for conversations about distributive justice and regenerative systems. ","The Assisi Declarations

a16E0000002QA3N,Net metering,Solution,"Net metering policy, now adopted by forty-three U.S. states, allows electricity end-users to “run the meter backwards,” meaning that utility customers can receive retail credit for generating solar power and feeding it back to the grid. This measure provides homeowners, businesses and industry with an economic incentive to install solar panels, while at the same time increasing the resilience and reducing the environmental impact of the grid by distributing power generation among many small energy producers. Particularly when accompanied by measures to encourage household, community, and co-operative energy generation projects, net metering can be a useful tool for distributing and democratizing the grid.","Net metering programs by US state

a16E0000002QA3I,Anchor procurement in Cleveland,Story,"Cleveland’s “anchor procurement” strategy leverages public or nonprofit, place-based anchor institutions — such as universities, hospitals, and local government — to use their purchasing power to seed community and employee-owned businesses in low-income communities. The Evergreen Cooperatives network, founded in 2009, now employs 100 people in three businesses — a commercial-scale laundry, a 3.25-acre greenhouse, and a solar and energy service business. Many cities have since launched similar efforts. Anchor procurement can also help support existing local businesses. For example, between 2005 and 2010, local procurement by University Hospitals as part of its $1.2-billion “Vision 2010” construction project generated nearly 1,000 jobs for Cleveland residents.   ","The Cleveland Model: Leveraging anchor purchasing for community benefit

Often focused on one or more specific populations such as workers at a company or residents in a neighborhood, credit unions are a vital alternative to large corporate banks — a value highlighted in the 2008 crash, during which U.S. credit unions saw relative stability while many banks were bailed out with massive infusions of public money. While not all credit unions live up to their promise, the institution is  structurally democratic, with each member having an equal vote in governance decisions. Credit unions can be an integral part of community-based development efforts, offering low-cost, locally accountable financial services.","Credit Union History
