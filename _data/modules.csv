"a16E0000002QGCU","Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative","Story","Decades of redlining, arson, and sham “urban renewal” efforts in the latter half of the twentieth century left 30 percent of the land in the Dudley neighborhood of Boston vacant. In response, residents started the Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative and launched a grassroots, community-controlled planning effort. Their Declaration of Community Rights states that residents, “have the right to participate in all planning, programs, and policies affecting our lives.” This ongoing effort has reclaimed land from absentee landlords — through a Community Land Trust with the power of eminent domain — and created hundreds of units of affordable housing, along with schools, parks, gardens, and other public spaces.","Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative

Using popular education techniques, the traffic mimes fanned out through the city, mocking lawbreakers, applauding courteous drivers, and dramatizing the frustrations and challenges of citizens moving through traffic. The result: a 50 percent drop in traffic fatalities, reduced traffic gridlock, and a marked shift in the traffic culture of the city.","Academic turns city into a social experiment

The Thunder Valley Community Development Corporation is building a net-zero “regenerative community” designed to sustainably produce all the energy it uses, managing their own construction to create both jobs and housing for the Oglala Lakota people. Elsewhere on Pine Ridge, Native-owned company Native American Natural is transitioning to employee ownership while bringing the buffalo back to Native lands.

The social imagination makes social change possible because an understanding of what might be gives us a perspective from which to challenge things as they are, as well as the hope and determination we need to build something different. To develop our social imaginations is to become more “wide-awake” to injustice in the world, a vital first step in inspiring us to change it.","The Maxinne Green Center

"a16E0000002QA0i","Non-extractive financial co-operative","Solution","A non-extractive financial cooperative is owned and operated by its members — the loan or equity recipients. Unlike most banks, its mission is not to extract profit from the community, but to leave more value in a community than it took out. For instance, it might provide the capital and technical assistance a small business needs to transition to community ownership. Rather than dictating the terms of investment, a non-extractive financial cooperative makes sure the terms are set by the people and communities involved. It thus inverts the power of capital, turning money into a tool for people — rather than the other way around.","Case Study: La Base / The Working World

The lesson is clear: to improve our health and wellbeing, we need to move beyond reactive healthcare and focus on the “upstream” factors — or social determinants — that most impact our health: income and its distribution, education, housing, nutrition, employment and the wider environment. Upstream thinking means taking wise collective action to ensure better outcomes rather than simply responding to, and being overwhelmed by, crises we could have foreseen.","Investigating the root causes of the global health crisis

Pooling their resources allowed workers to meet their financial needs and support the movement during the winter months, making it easier to strike in the summer. Six years after its founding, the Farm Workers Credit Union had loaned $183,000 to 874 members. ","Farm Worker Credit Union (essay & photos)

As much as anything else, human history is the story of groups of people trying to put democracy into practice; still today, the liberatory potential of true democracy continues to shine as a beacon for popular struggles worldwide. Whether it’s workers organizing to take over a shuttered factory, landless peasants squatting and farming on fallow land, or a neighborhood assembly deciding how their share of the city budget will be allocated, people are working together in countless ways to bring about a truly democratic world. The solutions that most deepen democracy are those that provide meaningful opportunities for people to participate — individually and in concert with others — in setting the course of their own lives.","","Dave Oswald Mitchell","","Boulder, Colorado vs. Xcel energy; Building community economies on Pine Rid; Cooperative Homecare Associates; Co-op Power; Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative; Initiative 136; Marinaleda's direct action economy; New Era Windows; Running Chokwe Lumumba for mayor; Southern Grassroots Economies Project; The Media Co-op; The Zapatista Little School; Working Families Party; Brazilian Landless Workers' Movement; Idle No More","Community land trusts; Community purchasing groups; Credit union; Housing cooperative; Non-extractive financial cooperative; Participatory budgeting; Re-municipalization; Solutions seized through direct action; Worker cooperative","Community as developer; Comunalidad; Cooperative commonwealth; Economic democracy; Horizontalism; Participatory democracy; Solidarity economics","cooperatives; decision-making; democracy; governance; justice; movement building; organized labor; peacebuilding; policy; politics; taxation","","","","",""

The Peer Production License (PPL), proposed by “venture communist” Dmytri Kleiner, is a reciprocity-based license by which commons are freely accessible to those who contribute to create them, while entities profiting from these commons without contributing are charged license fees. It helps protect digital, natural and biological resources such as software, seeds, plants and ancestral knowledge against the danger of privatization, while enabling their wider use. When paired with open-source producer cooperative models, the PPL can resist extractive global supply chains by supporting a reciprocal economy based on local industry and sustainable community sourcing, using open hardware designs and combined know-how.","Capital for the Commons

Our best solutions are those that dismantle the forces that hold us back, while constructing new ways of being in the world together. As adrienne maree brown writes, “We want to take actions that give us more options, give us more time, more resources, more life.” Solutions become transformational on a broad scale when they adapt to the times in imaginative ways, when they support thriving ecosystems of solutions by intentionally making use of the products of other revolutionary ideas that surround them, and when they change the conditions of their environment to make space for more solutions to take root.","","Rachel Berliner Plattus","","596 Acres; Anchor procurement in Cleveland; Building community economies on Pine Rid; Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative; Greenwave's restorative ocean farming; Initiative 136; Marinaleda's direct action economy; Running Chokwe Lumumba for mayor; Southern Grassroots Economies Project; The Zapatista Little School; Brazilian Landless Workers' Movement","Basic income; Job guarantee; Land value tax; Public banking; Shorter work week; Solutions seized through direct action; Divest/invest; Reclaiming common wealth","Buen vivir; Comunalidad; Emergent strategy; Horizontalism; Resilience-based organizing; Sense of place; Sharing economy; Social imagination; The commons","community development; movement building; open source; well-being","","","","",""

The current economic paradigm, however, runs on extraction. A coal company will strip mine an Appalachian hillside, and once they’ve taken all that’s valuable, leave behind an ugly, toxic scar. In a similar way, they also extract value out of the workers they employ. This kind of systematic extraction — of labor and carbon — is at the root of our twin crises of economic injustice and climate chaos. To survive as a species, and make our work lives more meaningful, we need to resist extraction, reduce consumption and build alternative institutions powered by renewable resources and freely associated labor.","","Andrew Boyd","","Boulder, Colorado vs. Xcel energy; Building community economies on Pine Rid; Co-op Power; Farm Workers Credit Union; Great Lakes Commons Initiative; Initiative 136; The Beaver Lake Cree's tarsands lawsuit; The river with the rights of a person; The Zapatista Little School; Brazilian Landless Workers' Movement; Idle No More","Community land trusts; Community purchasing groups; Maximum wage; Non-extractive financial cooperative; Re-municipalization; Shorter work week; Solutions seized through direct action; Worker cooperative; Divest/invest; Reclaiming common wealth","Buen vivir; Comunalidad; Decolonization; Economic democracy; Environmental justice; Horizontalism; Just transition; Resilience-based organizing; Sense of place; Solidarity economics; Stewardship; The commons; Usufruct","climate; community development; crisis response; economics; energy; indigenous rights; justice; land use; racial justice; resource use","","","","",""

The idea of the community as developer is that a whole community, or a substantial section of it, can be organized to carry out the functions of a developer, but rather than having maximum profit as their goal, they would have a goal of meeting common needs in a sustainable fashion and keeping wealth circulating within the community.","Why the 'teach a man to fish' parable is a lie

All of these are gifts we share and are obliged to preserve for others and for future generations.   
 
	Here’s the rub: under capitalism, common wealth is increasingly appro­­priated by private corporations and wealthy individuals for profit .

"a16E0000002QA2e","Stewardship","Theory","Diverse cultural and faith traditions teach us that no human ownership is truly absolute. Any control we have over the assets of this planet may be a gift from God, nature, or our ancestors, but one thing is for sure: our dominion is only temporary. Others bequeathed us these assets, and others will depend upon them after we are gone. Stewardship, as opposed to ownership, embraces this reality. Whereas ownership suggests a right to do as we please, stewardship emphasizes our responsibility to protect, cultivate, and serve that which nourishes us. As such, the concept of stewardship forms a solid foundation for conversations about distributive justice and regenerative systems. ","The Assisi Declarations

"a16E0000002QA3N","Net metering","Solution","Net metering policy, now adopted by forty-three U.S. states, allows electricity end-users to “run the meter backwards,” meaning that utility customers can receive retail credit for generating solar power and feeding it back to the grid. This measure provides homeowners, businesses and industry with an economic incentive to install solar panels, while at the same time increasing the resilience and reducing the environmental impact of the grid by distributing power generation among many small energy producers. Particularly when accompanied by measures to encourage household, community, and co-operative energy generation projects, net metering can be a useful tool for distributing and democratizing the grid.","Net metering programs by US state

"a16E0000002QA3I","Anchor procurement in Cleveland","Story","Cleveland’s “anchor procurement” strategy leverages public or nonprofit, place-based anchor institutions — such as universities, hospitals, and local government — to use their purchasing power to seed community and employee-owned businesses in low-income communities. The Evergreen Cooperatives network, founded in 2009, now employs 100 people in three businesses—a commercial-scale laundry, a 3.25-acre greenhouse, and a solar and energy service business. Many cities have since launched similar efforts. Anchor procurement can also help support existing local businesses. For example, between 2005 and 2010, local procurement by University Hospitals as part of its $1.2-billion “Vision 2010” construction project generated nearly 1,000 jobs for Cleveland residents.   ","The Cleveland Model: Leveraging anchor purchasing for community benefit

"a16E0000002QA2t","Credit union","Solution","A credit union is a cooperatively owned, not-for-profit financial institution that offers banking, loans, and other financial services to members. Often focused on one or more specific populations such as workers at a company or residents in a neighborhood, credit unions are a vital alternative to large corporate banks — a value highlighted in the 2008 crash, during which U.S. credit unions saw relative stability while many banks were bailed out with massive infusions of public money. While not all credit unions live up to their promise, the institution is  structurally democratic, with each member having an equal vote in governance decisions. Credit unions can be an integral part of community-based development efforts, offering low-cost, locally accountable financial services.","Credit Union History
